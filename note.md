# Encapsulation => means  - Encapsulation is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the bundling of data (variables) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or class.
-Inheritance => means  - , inheritance is implemented using prototypes. JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model, where each object can have a prototype object, from which it inherits properties and methods.
 # =polymorphism => means  - polymorphism refers to the ability of a function, object, or method to take many forms. It is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.
